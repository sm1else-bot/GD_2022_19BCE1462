## Doofus: Freefall

### Installation:

To play the game, all you have to do is download the build folder, extract the UnityPlayer.rar file to get the DLL, then extract the data parts as well.

To run the source code on Unity however, go to the Project Files folder after downloading and extract the parts so you get the .unitypackage source.

Now create a New URP Project with the latest version of unity and Import everything from the package, the folder "HW Task" contains all task specific assets (most of the important stuff besides some picture assets and a skybox or two)

#### Thanks to HitWicket for the opportunity

##### This was developed in a single stretch from 5PM on 10/9/2022 to 6AM on 11/9/2022, takes me back to the game jam days but working solo is another challenge. Thanks for playing.
